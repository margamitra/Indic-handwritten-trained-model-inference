# Indic-handwritten-trained-model-inference
These are the results of the inference performed on the Indian Handwritten trained models, trained on the IIT Indic words dataset. 
Each language has its respective folder, and the results of different inferences performed on it using various images from the net are stored in folders named as INF 1, INF 2 and so on. 

Each language model was infered on a minimum of atleast 3 images and a maximum of 5, depending upon the availablity of good quality hadwritten texts in that language. 

# Results 
Most of the handwritten models gave pretty decent results, and were able to detect the handwritten texts almost accurately, considering the fact that it is very difficult to get very high accuracies on handwritten text recognition models. 

The confidence level of the detected words and characters varied from as 19% (seen in the case of Urdu) to about even 89% (Tamil) in some cases, with an average of about 65%. It is to be noted that, the models perform significantly better on images which have a clearer and neat handwriting, without much gaps and spaces.
